# 🚀 What is Inkways?

Inkways is an upcoming integrated digital ink suite designed to transform how you work with notes, presentations, and creative workflows.
By blending **Ink**, **Presentation**, and **Flow** technologies, Inkways brings seamless digital writing experiences to every corner of your professional and personal life.

## 📅 Current Project Status & Roadmap

*Reality check: Inkways is currently in the **concept and design phase***. While our vision is ambitious, development is scheduled to begin in **mid-to-late 2026**. An initial preview build will launch with core functionality — additional features will roll out progressively.  

### Why the delay?

- Team resources are prioritized on foundational infrastructure and another core product.  

- Key members are upskilling or managing full-time commitments.  

- We’re committed to rebuilding Inkways using modern tech stacks — no shortcuts.  

### ⚠️ About Older Versions:

A legacy Windows-only build (Inkways Legacy) has been **discontinued indefinitely** due to technical limitations. All future development focuses on the redesigned suite.

## 🚫 Critical Advisory: Avoid Scams!

*Since Inkways isn't yet in development:*  

- **No downloads exist** — any "installer" is fraudulent, malicious, or a scam.

- **No XP/legacy OS support** — or plans for domestic Chinese OSes.  

- **No lifetime licenses** — launch pricing will be transparent and affordable (~$3/month or something like that, TBD).
